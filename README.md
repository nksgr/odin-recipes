# odin-recipies
My first Odin Project;

In this project, I am applying the basics of HTML to create a recipe project which has 5 of my favorite Indian recipes. Later on, when I learn CSS and Javacript, this page will appear more lively, colorful and pretty-looking! 

**Recipes taken from:** 

1) Butter Chicken: Simply Kitchen
2) Veg Momos: India TV
3) Paneer Tikka: Ministry of Curry && Pudina Chutney by Dassana's Veg recipes
