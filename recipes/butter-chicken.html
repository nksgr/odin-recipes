    </ul>
    <h3>Procedure</h3>
    <ol> 
        <h4>Marinate the chicken</h4>
        <li>Bring the chicken and the rest of the marinade ingredients together in a large bowl.</li>
        <li>Using your hands, massage the marinade into the chicken. </li>
        <li>Cover with plastic wrap and refrigerate for at least 1 hour, or up to overnight. </li>
        
        <h4>Soaking</h4>
        <li>Soak cashews and almonds in water for at least an hour</li>
        
        <h4>Cooking the chicken </h4>
        <li>Heat a skillet or grill pan over medium-high heat. Drizzle a teaspoon of oil to the pan.</li>
        <li>Working in batches, remove chicken from the marinade and grill them on the pan for 3 to 5 minutes on each side, until the chicken is cooked through (clear juice runs out of it when you cut into it).</li>
        <li>Once cooked, transfer the chicken into a separate dish. Cover and set aside for later. </li>
        
        <h4>Making the Sauce</h4>
        <li>Melt 1 1/2 tablespoons of the butter in a medium sized pot, on medium heat</li>
        <li>As soon as the butter melts, add the ginger garlic paste followed by sugar. Saut√© for 1 to 2 minutes. </li>
        <li>Stir in the tomato and cook for 8 to 10 minutes on medium high heat, until all the extra liquid is cooked off. The sauce should be a loose, paste-like consistency. </li>     
        <li>Add coriander, garam masala, Kashmiri Lal Mirch, and salt. Stir and cook on medium heat for 2 to 3 minutes. Turn off the heat. </li>
        
        <h4>Blending the Sauce</h4>
        <li>Transfer the paste to a blender or the bowl of a food processor. Add the soaked cashews and almonds. Blend into a smooth paste. </li>
        
        <h4>Finishing </h4>
        <li>Return the paste to the cooking pan over medium heat. Add the water to the paste and stir to make a smooth sauce. </li>

        <li>As the sauce begins to boil, add the grilled chicken and heavy cream. Stir well. Cover the pan and simmer for 5 minutes. </li>
        <li>Turn off the heat and uncover the pan.</li>
        <li>Stir in the remaining 1/2 tablespoon butter and the kasuri methi.</li>
        <li>Cover again, and let the dish rest for 8 to 10 minutes so the flavor of kasuri methi can marry into the butter chicken. </li>
        
        <h4>Serving</h4>
        <li>Serve the butter with a side of steamed basmati rice, roti, or naan. </li>
